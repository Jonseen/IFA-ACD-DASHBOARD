      <p className="opacity-70 text-sm">
        The ACD is a one-stop shop for everything accessibility in Nigeria. A
        first of its kind, the Dashboard seeks to keep track of the extent of
        (disability) accessibility within public and private institutions in
        line with the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities
        (Prohibition) Act, 2018 (&quot;the Disability Act&quot;).
      </p>
      <p className="opacity-70 text-sm">
        {" "}The Dashboard profiles public and private organisations in Nigeria,
        and records and ranks the extent of accessibility and disability
        inclusion in the organisations based on the national accessibility
        standards and best practices.
      </p>
      <p className="opacity-70 text-sm">
        {" "}The Disability Act aims to promote the inclusion and rights of
        Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in public and private life. Among other
        things, the Act provides for access to employment for PWDs(at least 5%
        employment) and equal access to public facilities/structures.The Act
        provides a 5-yeartransition period within which all public buildings and
        structures that are inaccessible to PWDs shall be modified to become
        accessible to and usable by PWDs. The transition period ended in January
        2024.
      </p>
      <p className="opacity-70 text-sm">
        {" "}IFA developed the ACD to help organisations understand their
        responsibilities in respect of accessibility under the Disability Act
        and to help them achieve their goals in this regard. We are interested
        in learning more about the progress your organisation has made or is
        making towards ensuring an accessible and inclusive workplace for all
        employees.
      </p>
      <p className="opacity-70 text-sm">
        Having your organisation profiled on the ACD would improve disability
        inclusion in your organisation, and position your organisation as a
        champion of disability inclusion in Nigeria.
